## Installation

**This plugin is only compatible with Redmine 2.3.x ! See #7 for more informations about 2.4+ incompatibilities.**

Please apply general instructions for plugins [here](http://www.redmine.org/wiki/redmine/Plugins).

Note that this plugin now depends on:
* **redmine_base_select2** which can be found [here](https://github.com/jbbarth/redmine_base_select2)
* **redmine_base_deface** which can be found [here](https://github.com/jbbarth/redmine_base_deface)

First download the source or clone the plugin and put it in the "plugins/" directory of your redmine instance. Note that this is crucial that the directory is named 'redmine_better_crossprojects' !

Then execute:

    $ bundle install
    $ rake redmine:plugins

And finally restart your Redmine instance.
